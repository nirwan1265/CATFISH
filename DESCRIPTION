Description: MAGCAT provides an R interface to MAGMA (Multi-marker Analysis of
    GenoMic Annotation) for post-GWAS pathway enrichment analysis. It implements
    multiple p-value combination methods (ACAT, Fisher, Stouffer, minP, adaptive
    soft TFisher) and combines them into an omnibus test with optional
    permutation-based or MVN-based calibration to account for gene-gene
    correlations. Built-in support for Plant Metabolic Network (PMN) pathways
    for maize, sorghum, arabidopsis, and general plant species.
